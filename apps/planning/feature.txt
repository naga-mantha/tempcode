I need the following 2 models in apps/common/models.py
Also add them to admin.py

Planned Orders
- Order (Char)
- Item (FK to ITEM)
- Quantity (Float)
- Unit of Measure (FK to UOM)
- Type (Planned Puchase Order/Planned Production Order) - SELECT
- Planned Start Date - Date
- Planned End Date - Date
- Required Date - Date

MRP Messages
- Model (Purchase Order/Production Order) - SELECT
- Model Value (FK to the relevant model - PurchaseOrderLine/ProductionOrder)
- MRP message - Text
- MRP Reschedule Date - Date
- Reschedule Date delta - Integer (This is 'MRP Reschedule Date' - 'final_receive_date' for PurchaseOrderLine. For ProductionOrder, it is blank. final_receive_date is from PurchaseOrderLine model)
- Direction (Pull in/Push Out) - SELECT (Its 'Pull In' if 'Reschedule Date delta' is negative, else 'Push Out')


Q&A

  - File location: Your repo uses modular files under apps/common/models/*. Ok to add new models as apps/common/models/planning.py (and import in apps/common/models/init.py), instead of a monolithic apps/
  common/models.py?          > No, add to apps/common/models.py


  - PlannedOrder
      - Field lengths: Is order up to 20 chars (or 50)? Any uniqueness constraint? > 20 characters, Fields combination (order, type) should be unique
      - Nullability: Can dates (planned_start_date, planned_end_date, required_date) be blank/null? Is uom required? > Can be blank/null
      - Type choices: Exactly "Planned Purchase Order" and "Planned Production Order"? Want short codes stored (e.g., PPR/PPD) and human labels, or store full strings? > Use PPUR/PPRO
  - MrpMessage
      - Relation design: Should we use a GenericForeignKey (content_type + object_id) to support both PurchaseOrderLine and ProductionOrder, or do you prefer two nullable FKs (pol and prod_order) with a
  model choice to indicate which is set?           > GenericForeignKey
      - Direction/delta: Should reschedule_delta_days and direction be computed on save? > YES
      - You said delta is “Reschedule Date - final_receive_date” for POL, blank for ProductionOrder. Store blank/NULL for
  production? Direction computed as 'Pull In' if negative, 'Push Out' otherwise — OK to derive and persist? > Correction. It should be "MRP Reschedule Date' - 'final_receive_date'". And yes you can store NULL/blank for production order.
      - Nullability: Is mrp_reschedule_date optional? Should messages exist without a date?           > Optional
      - Indexes: Do you want indexes for mrp_reschedule_date, direction, or model to make reporting faster?     > Yes
  - Admin
      - For PlannedOrder, which columns should be in list_display? I propose: order, item, quantity, uom, type, required_date. > OK
      - For MrpMessage, I propose: model, [target ref], mrp_message, mrp_reschedule_date, reschedule_delta_days, direction.        > OK
