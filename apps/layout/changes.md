Redundancies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
- Unused imports: views.py imports QueryDict and Block but doesn’t use them; reverse appears unused. -> User: Do it                                                                                                                                         
- Duplicate conditions: can_edit and can_delete compute the same condition; define once and reuse. -> User: Can you explain which file this is?                                                                                                                                            
- Duplicate logic: _build_filter_schema() is implemented twice (in LayoutDetailView and LayoutFilterConfigView) with identical code.  -> User: Abstract it                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Can Be Abstracted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
- Filter schema build: Extract a LayoutFilterSchemaMixin with a single _build_filter_schema(request) method used by both views.  -> User: Do it                                                                                                               
- Column choices: ALLOWED_COLS = (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12) is duplicated across AddBlockForm and LayoutBlockForm. Centralize as apps/layout/constants.py or on the LayoutBlock model and import in both forms.  -> User: Do it
- Permission checks: Centralize the layout access checks (private/public + owner/staff) into a helper/mixin to avoid repeating in LayoutDetailView and LayoutEditView.  -> User: Do it
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Code Improvements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
- LayoutDetailView.dispatch and LayoutFilterConfigView.dispatch: Drop extra positional args when calling super().dispatch(...). Use return super().dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs).  -> User: Do it                                                        
- Model validation: Add validators or a CheckConstraint for LayoutBlock.col to restrict to allowed choices at the DB level (forms already enforce this).  -> User: Do it                                                              
- Slug policy: Currently Layout.save() overwrites slug on every save (URL instability). If you want stable URLs, only set slug on create; otherwise document that renaming changes the URL.  -> User: Document that renaming will change the URL.
- Signals: Replace bare except Exception: pass with logging to avoid swallowing errors silently.  -> User: Do it
- Query efficiency: You already use select_related("block") well. Consider adding an index for (layout_id, position) on LayoutBlock since it’s a hot ordering pattern.  -> User: Do it
- Defaults semantics: LayoutFilterConfig.save() keeps “one default” when setting one as default, and prevents deleting the last config. It is still possible to end up with zero defaults by editing; that’s acceptable but should be documented (or enforced if you prefer invariants).  -> User: When only one LayoutFilterConfig is left, it shouldn't allow to remove the "default" flag. Check the TableBlock Filter too, it should have the same feature.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                         
Documentation Review (apps/layout/documentation.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
- Contradiction about default filter creation:                                                                                                                                                                                                
    - Earlier section says “On first visit … lazily created named ‘None’ … set as default.” Code does not lazily create in views. -> User: Update it                                                                                                    
    - Later it correctly says “Default filters are provided by signals only (no lazy creation in view).”  -> User: Update it
