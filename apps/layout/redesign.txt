  - Sidebar behavior: Is Bootstrap Offcanvas acceptable for the overlapping, closable sidebar? If yes:
      - Default state closed on mobile, open or closed on desktop?   > Closed on all devices
      - Persist open/closed state in localStorage?                   > Yes

  - Sidebar contents:
      - Private Layouts = only current user’s private layouts? > Yes
      - Public Layouts = all public? Any limit or scroll if long? > All public. Scroll if long.
      - Order by name ascending? Highlight the current layout in both lists? > Ascending. Highlight current layout in both lists.
      - Each item links to that layout’s detail; show “by ” for public? > Dont show "by" for public.
  - Header actions: Keep “Edit Layout” on left and keep “Layout Filter” dropdown + “Manage Filters” + “Reset” on the right (as in your sketch)? > Yes
