I want a ToDo model in the "common" app with the following fields:
1. Title - CharField, max_length=200
2. Description - TextField
3. Status - "Not Started", "In Progress", "Completed"
4. Created_at - DateTimeField, auto_now_add=True
5. Updated_at - DateTimeField, auto_now=True
6. Dependencies - ManyToManyField to self, blank=True

For the template, I would need a page which
1. Lists all ToDo items placed in a Bootstrap accordion
2. The accordion should contain:
    - Title
    - Dependencies. Use pill badges (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/badge/#pill-badges). The background color of the badge should be in accordance with the status of the ToDo item (See below for coloring)
3. The description should be in the accordion body
4. The background color of the accordion should be in accordance with the status of the ToDo item
   - Not Started - Secondary
   - In Progress - Primary
   - Completed - Success
 You can use the Bootstrap classes for this
 5. The accordion should be draggable to change the priority. You can use SortJS for this.


 Q&A
  - Priority field: To support drag-to-reorder, can I add an IntegerField priority (with model Meta.ordering = ['priority'])?
        > Yes
  - Status choices: OK to implement via TextChoices with default “Not Started”?
        > Dropdown
  - Description required: Should description be optional (blank=True) or required?
        > Optional
  - Dependencies coloring: Should each dependency badge color match the dependency item’s own status or the parent item’s status?
        > Dependency item’s own status
  - Sortable library: You wrote “SortJS” — do you mean SortableJS via CDN?
        > Yes
  - URL + template: OK to add path('todos/', todo_list, name='todo_list') and template at apps/common/templates/todo_list.html?
        > Yes
  - Reorder endpoint: OK to add a POST endpoint path('todos/reorder/', ...) that accepts an ordered list of IDs and updates priorities?
        > Yes
  - Admin/CRUD: Do you want Django admin registration and/or basic create/edit views now, or is listing + drag-reorder sufficient?
        > I would need admin too
