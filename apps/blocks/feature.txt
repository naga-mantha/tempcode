RepeaterBlock

Requirements
Can we abstract it into a RepeaterBlock? I am thinking of the following:
1. RepeaterBlock should take an input of a registered blockName
2. It should take an input of what the repeater should be based on (ex: Buyer)
3. It should take an input of how many cols per row (Basically bootstrap columns)
4. I am thinking the column settings/filter settings should be saved at the RepeaterBlock level

Q&A
- Supported child types: Should it repeat any registered block (tables, pivots, charts), or only those with filters?
    > Any registered block type
- Dimension source: How should we enumerate panels?                                                                                                           
    - Provide a model + field path (e.g., apps.common.PurchaseOrderLine, order__buyer), or a callable? Include “Unassigned/null”?                             
    - For your current use-case, do we restrict enumeration to overdue lines (final_receive_date < today)?
- Child filter mapping: What filter key should the child block receive (e.g., buyer)? Is this always a single filter key, or sometimes multiple?
     >  Multiple filter keys
- Child configs: When you say “column settings/filter settings saved at RepeaterBlock level,” do you want the repeater to store and inject:                   
    - a specific child BlockFilterConfig (by name or id), and                                                                                                 
    - a specific child BlockColumnConfig (by name or id),
into every repeated child instance?
    >  Yes, both.

- Layout of panels: For “cols per row,” is selecting a Bootstrap span okay (1,2,3,4,6,12), or do you prefer “N panels per row” and I’ll compute col = 12 // N?
    >  Bootstrap span (1,2,3,4,6,12) so that it can be consistent with other blocks
- Ordering/limits: Do you want sorting of panels (e.g., by label or by a computed metric) and/or a “top N” limit?
    >  Make the sorting a variable
- Panel titles: Use the raw dimension label (e.g., buyer username) and a custom label for null (e.g., “Unassigned”)?
    > Make it configurable
- Settings UX: Mirror Pivot’s saved settings pattern (RepeaterConfig per user/block with default selection), with its own “Manage Settings” page?
    > Yes. Program its own "Manage Settings" page
